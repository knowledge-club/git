# init

To start to track a project with git, on your console, go to the projects directory ant type

```bash
$ git init
```

This command will create a folder named `.git` that contains some necessary files to track repository (repository is a name given to the different versions from a project with git)

Now, your folder is ready to get tracked with git!
